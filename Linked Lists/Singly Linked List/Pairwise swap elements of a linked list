Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

 

Example:

Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.



class Solution 
{
public Node pairwiseSwap(Node head)
{
    Node curr = head;

    while(curr != null && curr.next != null)
    {
        int x = curr.next.value;
        curr.next.value = curr.value;
        curr.value = x;

        curr = curr.next.next;
    }
    return head;
}
}
